Mininberg -- Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Jack. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. This afternoon, we reported a great start to our fiscal year. Also, a great start to Phase II of our transformation plan, which we detailed during our May 21 Investor Day in New York.\nConsolidated core business sales grew 6.8% and adjusted diluted EPS grew 10.2% in the quarter, both ahead of our expectations given the especially high year-ago base.\nSales growth was driven by our Leadership Brands, which grew 7.4%. Our continued focus and investments in innovation and marketing paid off handsomely. We gained further ground online with sales growing 28% now representing 23% of consolidated sales for the quarter. These operating results give us the fuel to further increase our spending behind attractive investment opportunities for the balance of the year, and also raise our revenue and EPS outlook for fiscal 2020. Before continuing my discussion on the quarter's results, I'd like to express my sincere appreciation for those of you who attended or listened to our Investor Day.\nIn addition, to presenting our Phase II plans, we introduced you to some of the outstanding leaders in our Company, shared our long-term financial goals for Phase II and gave you a flavor of the culture and level of engagement that our people bring to work every day. We believe their passionate commitment powers Helen of Troy and is a key driver of success as our Phase II plans come to life.\nAs outlined during Investor Day, Phase II to builds on the accomplishments of Phase I by focusing on eight key strategic priorities. These are investing in Leadership Brands, doubling down on international, selective and strategic M&A, consumer-centric, unifying and elevating the best people, accelerating shared service excellence, maximizing operating efficiency and optimizing capital deployment.\nSince deploying these strategies internally nine months ago, we have been implementing them to bring next level capabilities to our organization and pursue new growth opportunities for our leadership brands. OXO, Hydro Flask, Vicks, Braun, Honeywell, PUR and Hot Tools comprised approximately 80% of our net sales and an even higher proportion of our operating profit. They sweeten our mix as we continue to grow them.\nThe Innovation Showcase section of Investor Day revealed important new product launches and highlighted the skill and creativity of our consumer-centric engineers, leaders and our sales and marketing organizations. They worked tirelessly to match consumer insights and trends to new technologies and differentiated timeless designs. For us delighting end-consumers with branded solutions they love and trust is a healthy obsession. Again, thank you to everyone who joined us during Investor Day.\nNow, I'd like to turn to review of our business segments in this quarter. Sales growth was led by our Housewares segment, which increased core business net sales by 23.8% with growth across both brands, outstanding. OXO saw a strong growth, a key brick-and-mortar retailers as we gained distribution, benefited from solid POS and improved store traffic at key retailers. New product introductions contributed to OXO's growth as both retailers and consumers responded well to new launches. Further investment in OXO's equity in store, and e-commerce and via digital marketing were also key drivers. The Food Storage and Kitchen Organization categories were particularly strong and on-trend with the rising popularity of organizational gurus that focused on de-cluttering and household Organization.\nFor Hydro Flask another outstanding quarter, the brand's strong equity and popularity continue to grow with outdoor enthusiasts and retailers alike. It continues to expand its number one market share position and reinforced its role as a key contributor to category growth for high-performance insulated hydration vessels. The brand made terrific strides with retailers and consumers on the East Coast of the United States, especially in the Northeast where we further expanded Hydro Flask offerings in brick-and-mortar, broadened placement on the shelf and expanded the selection of on-trend and trend setting items.\nWe are seeing strong point-of-sale results and inventory replenishment orders in-line with accelerating sell-through for those customers where we have the visibility. In addition, to Hydro Flask's growing brand equity, the introduction of a new spring collection of refreshingly bold colors across the hydration, coffee, beer and food lines is resonating well with consumers.\nHydro Flask also advanced its Beyond-the-Bottle strategy with the announcement of a number of new products in its growing line of soft goods, including two new high-performance hydration packs. The first is the new 14-liter downshift hydration pack designed to provide a lower center of gravity and increased stability.\nThe second is the new 16-liter women's hydration pack tailored through the back panel, shoulder straps and hip belt to fit more comfortably on a woman's body. These new consumer-centric insulated hydration backpacks are especially suited to mountain bikers and hikers. Their innovative cold flow system allows for more than four hours of hands-free cold hydration. More new products are on the way, both in-bottles and beyond. Outside the US, Hydro Flask continues to grow and has targeted key markets as we double-down on the international. We believe Hydro Flask offers much more promise and can be a leading environmental and sustainability forward authentic global brand.\nTurning to the Health and Home segment, core business net sales declined 4% in the quarter in the face of a difficult comparison to the prior year. However, we made sequential improvements in Asia Pacific as retailers sold down previously elevated inventory levels, earned incremental US distribution for our Vicks thermometers and our vapor lines and introduced new products.\nRecent new launches such as the Honeywell Dreamweaver Sleep Fan have been well received. A great example of our Just One More strategy this product furthers the reach of Honeywell fans into households. The Dreamweaver extended the brand into the sleep category with new benefits that can keep a formerly seasonal product front and center all year long. It uses a soothing sound frequency zone called Pink Noise to provide sound blocking benefits that can help promote deeper more restorative sleep, to help it earn and keep a spot on night stands, it also includes a USB charger for bedside essentials like phones.\nSimilarly, in Beauty consumer-centric innovation continues to be a key success driver. The appliance momentum of the past two years accelerated in the quarter, driving 3.8% growth in core business -- sorry, 3.8% growth in core business sales for Beauty. Our innovations combined with digital marketing and increasingly viral support for consumers are key drivers of this success. Online and international were also standouts in the quarter for appliances. We have rapidly earned a large base of 4- and 5-star ratings on key websites and are earning strong support from bloggers and media as word spreads.\nStepping away from the business segment. I would like to now spotlight, some of the other Phase II strategies where we made good progress in the quarter namely accelerating shared service excellence, maximizing operating efficiency and unifying and elevating the best people. For shared services, a key focus area in Phase II is building further excellence in our processes. We have begun, what we call the Helen of Troy Way which include simplifying, standardizing and systematizing over 150 unique processes across our supply chain with the intent to create new efficiencies, lower inventory and reduce out-of-stocks at the point-of-purchase.\nAs an example, at the very end of May, we rolled out an upgrade of our Oracle demand planning tool. This is key when managing a complex global portfolio across multiple product categories, regions and customer requirements. In addition, during the quarter we also successfully transitioned our Hydro Flask direct-to-consumer operations from a third-party partner to our own distribution center. And are now in the midst of transitioning our customizing -- our customization operations and retail distribution in-house. We expect these actions will help improve cost, quality and speed. These changes and many more like them that are planned for Phase II would not be possible without the culture of collaboration that is now second nature across all Helen of Troy business units , shared services and regional organizations.\nDuring Phase 1, we substantially upgraded our talent pool. In Phase II we are emphasizing training and raising the bar on performance expectations. During the quarter, we rolled out our new Helen of Troy Academy, an in-house suite of training programs that helps each associate sharpen their skills and reach their full potential. It has been very well received and the new skills will take our people even farther.\nBefore I turn the call over to Brian. I want to thank you again for your trust and support as we focus on Phase II. We have created a flywheel with considerable potential for further value creation. It power starts with our people who are focused on organic revenue growth, margin expansion from innovation and investments in our Leadership Brands. It gains efficiency from improvements to shared services and working capital. Further momentum, comes from our debt and tax structure, and accretive low-risk deployment of capital. We believe these powerful elements drive the flywheel. They also underscore my belief that the brightest days for Helen of Troy are ahead of us.\nWith that I will now turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian L. Grass -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you Julien. Good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased with our first quarter results and to be in a position to raise our full-year outlook. Before discussing the quarter in more detail, I'd like to further discuss the impact of tariffs, since I know this is an important topic for many of you as it is for us. As I outlined during our Investor Day in May, we have been planning for the List-3 tariff increase from 10% to 25% for some time and believe we're in a good position to take pricing and supply chain actions to mitigate the impact of those increases.\nIn terms of the recently announced List-4, these tariffs were introduced for public comment, but have now been postponed pending a potential trade deal with China. As List-4 has not been implemented. We have not considered any changes to our fiscal 2020 outlook at this point. If ultimately implemented, we anticipate taking the same approach that we've taken in the past. The goal would be to offset the vast majority of the gross profit dollar impact with pricing, cost reductions, supplier consolidation and other mitigation efforts.\nI'd also like to explain the impact of the new UK Offshore Receipts in respect of Intangible Property tax commonly referred to as ORIP tax and foreign currency fluctuations that I will be discussing during the call. Beginning with the new UK ORIP tax where intangible properties held offshore and that property is used to facilitate sales in the UK, sales could be subject to UK Gross Receipts tax of 20 %.\nThe tax came into effect during the middle of the first quarter and there are still many aspects of the legislation and implementation that remain unclear. We intend to treat this as a transactional tax included in operating expenses. While we do not believe the tax will have a material adverse impact on our operating results, it is a headwind for the first quarter and fiscal 2020, that was not included in our original outlook.\nTurning to currency average foreign exchange rates were generally unfavorable compared to the same period last year, which negatively impacted net sales and gross profit. You'll also hear me You will also hear me refer to a favorable impact from foreign currency in SG&A, which primarily relates to the settlement of forward contracts that are intended to offset unfavorable impact of currency on net sales and gross profit.\nTurning to review of the quarter, we achieved strong results with adjusted diluted EPS above our expectations, largely due to stronger than expected net sales in Housewares and Beauty in the second half of the quarter. Consolidated sales revenue was $376.3 million, a 6.1% increase over the prior year driven by a core business increased of 6.8%, reflecting an increase in brick-and-mortar sales in the Houseware segment, growth in consolidated online sales and an increase in appliance sales in the Beauty segment. Sales in the online channel grew approximately 28% year-over-year to now comprise approximately 23% of our consolidated net sales in the first quarter. These factors were partially offset by lower international sales in the Health and Home segment, a decline in personal care sales within the Beauty segment and the unfavorable impact from foreign currency of approximately $2.5 million or 0.7%.\nThis was a very strong quarter for the Houseware segment, which posted a core business increase of 23.8%, as the segment continues to see strong demand for both OXO and Hydro Flask brands, online and in-store, with new product introductions contributing meaningfully to growth. In-line with our expectations Health and Home core business, net sales decreased 4%, which reflects a difficult comparison to expanded international distribution in the tail end of a strong cough-cold-flu season in the same period last year. These factors were partially offset by incremental distribution with existing domestic customers and early replenishment of certain seasonal categories.\nBeauty core business, net sales increased 3.8% primarily due to growth in the appliance category, especially online and growth in international. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in brick-and-mortar and a decline in personal care. Consolidated gross profit margin was 40.8% compared to 41.3%. The 0.5 percentage point decrease is primarily due to the impact of tariff increases, unfavorable foreign currency and higher freight expense, partially offset by the favorable margin impact from growth from Leadership Brands and a higher mix of Houseware sales.\nSG&A was 28.1% of net sales compared to 28.6%, the 0.5 percentage point decrease is primarily due to the impact of our pricing actions taken with retail customers, the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange and forward contract settlements, the impact of greater operating leverage and lower product liability claim expense. These factors were partially offset by higher annual incentives and share-based compensation expense related to short- and long-term performance, higher new product development expense and higher advertising expense.\nGAAP operating income was $47.2 million or 12.5% of net sales. This compares to $43.3 million or 12.2% of net sales in the same period last year. The increase in margin was driven by the favorable comparative impact of restructuring charges of $1.1 million and lower SG&A as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a reduction in gross profit margin. Adjusted operating income of $59.3 million or 15.8% of net sales compared to $55.5 million or 15.6% of net sales.\nTurning now to adjusted operating margin by segment, Housewares adjusted operating margin was 23.7% compared to 21.7%, the 2 percentage point increase primarily reflects the margin impact of a more favorable product and channel mix and greater operating leverage. These factors were partially offset by higher advertising investment to support the brands, new product launches, and expanded distribution, higher annual incentive compensation expense and higher new product development expense. Health and Home adjusted operating margin was 13.7% compared to 15.3%. The 1.6 percentage point decrease primarily reflects the impact of tariff increases, the unfavorable impact of foreign currency on net sales and gross profit, higher new product development expense, lower operating leverage, and a less favorable product and channel mix.\nThese factors were partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange and forward contract settlements in SG&A and lower product liability claim expense.\nBeauty adjusted operating margin was 4.8% compared to 6.8%, the 2 percentage point decrease is primarily due to higher freight expense to meet the strong demand in the appliance category, a less favorable product and channel mix and higher new product development expense. These factors were partially offset by lower advertising and amortization expense.\nOur effective tax rate was 7.6% compared to 6.2%. The year-over-year increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to shifts in the mix of taxable income in the Company's various tax jurisdictions and increases in certain statutory tax rates.\nIncome from continuing operations was $40.7 million or $1.61 per diluted share compared to $38.2 million or $1.43 per diluted share. Non-GAAP adjusted income from continuing operations was $52.1 million or $2.06 per diluted share compared to $49.8 million or $1.87 per diluted share. This represents a 10.2% increase in adjusted diluted EPS, despite unfavorable foreign currency, the new UK ORIP tax and an increase in growth investments year-over-year. We are pleased to deliver strong growth on top of a 32.6% increase in adjusted diluted EPS in the same period last year.\nNow moving onto our financial position, accounts receivable turnover increased to 66.8 days for the first quarter compared to 62.6 days in the same period last year. Turnover as an average trailing 12-month calculation and the increase primarily reflects the timing of revenue growth and cash collections period-over-period.\nOur accounts receivable balance at the end of the first quarter was $252.5 million compared to $255.7 million at the same time last year. Trailing 12-month inventory turnover improved to 3.2 times compared to 3.1 times in the prior year period. Inventory was $335.3 million compared to $256.3 million at the same time last year. The increase largely reflects temporarily higher inventory levels to avoid any potential disruption in supply, as we continue certain strategic supplier consolidations and as we complete the integration of Hydro Flask into one of our core distribution facilities.\nWe expect to improve our inventory levels as these projects are completed. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased $13.2 million compared to the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in cash used for inventory. This was partially offset by a decrease in cash used by accrued expenses and other current liabilities.\nTotal short and long-term debt was $321.1 million compared to $300.1 million. Our leverage ratio was 1.3 times for both periods. Our first quarter results are a good example of how this dynamic omnichannel retail environment can alter the cadence of our quarterly results. As we continue to adapt to this evolving landscape and quickly capitalize on opportunities.\nRetailers are adjusting to the same environment, which can result in order volatility. Our digital advertising initiatives have been effective and measurable, but can also vary quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year. Despite this variability, we are pleased with our operational execution and ability to achieve consistent annual results and expect to continue to prioritize annual performance and the long-term health of our businesses.\nTurning to our outlook, although it is early in our fiscal year, we are increasing our full-year expectations to reflect the strength of the first quarter. We are especially pleased to increase our adjusted diluted EPS outlook while making incremental growth investments and absorbing unfavorable impact from foreign currency and the new UK ORIP tax, all of which were not included in our original outlook.\nFor fiscal 2020, we now expect consolidated net sales revenue in the range of $1.59 billion to $1.62 billion which implies consolidated sales growth of 1.7% to 3.6% compared to the prior expectation of 1% to 3%. Our net sales outlook reflects an increase in Housewares net sales growth to 6% to 8% compared to our prior expectation of 4% to 6%. We are maintaining our outlook for health and home net sales growth of 2% to 3% and we are maintaining our outlook for Beauty net sales decline in the low single-digits, which includes the expectation for a third consecutive year of growth in our appliance business.\nWe now expect consolidated GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations from $6.80 to $6.97 and non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $8.40 to $8.65, which excludes any asset impairment charges, restructuring charges, share-based compensation expense, and intangible asset amortization expense. Our net sales and diluted EPS outlook assume the severity of the upcoming cough-cold-flu season will be in-line with historical averages, and that June 2019 foreign currency exchange rates will remain constant for the remainder of the fiscal year.\nThe year-over-year comparison of adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations is impacted by an expected increase in growth investments of 12% to 17% in fiscal 2020, compared to our prior expectation of 10% to 15%. Our diluted EPS outlook is based on estimated diluted shares outstanding of 20.3 million. The increase in adjusted diluted EPS outlook reflects our strong performance in the first quarter, partially offset by the expected impact of the new UK ORIP tax, the expected unfavorable impact from the assumption that June 2019 foreign currency exchange rates will remain constant for the rest of fiscal 2020 and the expected increase in growth investments, compared to our original outlook.\nCombined, these items have an impact of approximately $0.20 per diluted share. We continue to expect adjusted EPS growth for fiscal 2020 to be concentrated in the second half of the year, due to strong performance comparison and specific events in the first half of fiscal 2019. We now expect growth in adjusted diluted EPS for the first half of fiscal 2020 of 4% to 6% year-over-year. We expect the reported GAAP effective tax rate range of 9.9% to 11.9% and an adjusted effective tax rate range of 9.1% to 10.7% for the full fiscal year 2020. The likelihood and potential impact of any fiscal 2020 acquisitions and divestitures, future asset impairment charges, future foreign currency fluctuations, further tariff increases or further share repurchases are unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated, therefore they are not included in our sales and earnings outlook.\nNow I'd like to turn it back to the operator for questions.\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nThank you. (Operator Instructions) We'll go first to Frank Camma with Sidoti.\nFrank Camma -- Sidoti & Company, LLC -- Analyst\nHi, good afternoon guys.\nBrian L. Grass -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Hey, Frank. How you're doing?\nFrank Camma -- Sidoti & Company, LLC -- Analyst\nGood, thanks for taking the question. Hey, a couple of things, can you start -- I know you gave some color on this, but can you talk a little bit more about the cadence of the quarter, given the size of the beat here. I mean obviously you called out Housewares and Beauty and it sounds like it was really back-end weighted, was that replenishments, was that new distribution? Can you go a little bit more into that by segment?\nBrian L. Grass -- Chief Financial Officer\nSure. I think there is -- while we don't expect 23% growth in that segment on an ongoing basis, I would say there is not a lot of unusual things driving sales there. It's being driven by strong demand for both Hydro Flask and OXO products and solid distribution but not what I would call a lot of pipeline filled. It's really mostly being driven by demand, and maybe it's a little bit lumpy based on the timing of some of the programs that's going on at the retailers. But, I would call nothing incredibly unusual, and you're right, it was concentrated more in the back half of the quarter, which is why--\nFrank Camma -- Sidoti & Company, LLC -- Analyst\nAnd there is no club channel either. It sounded more or less, I should say?\nBrian L. Grass -- Chief Financial Officer\nLess. There was club channel in both periods, but less in the first quarter of this year compared to the same quarter last year.\nJulien R. Mininberg -- Chief Executive Officer\nSo that leaveas the high (inaudible) .\nFrank Camma -- Sidoti & Company, LLC -- Analyst\nOkay.\nJulien R. Mininberg -- Chief Executive Officer\nSo as far as (multilple speakers) (inaudible)\nFrank Camma -- Sidoti & Company, LLC -- Analyst\nGo ahead, I'm sorry, go ahead.\nJulien R. Mininberg -- Chief Executive Officer\nBut then -- I apologize, Juli\\en here and I'm sorry to interrupt either of you. I want to say also that it in the Beauty segment, we just really had very strong demand in the appliances and as product came in, especially late in the quarter as Brian mentioned, even in the last few weeks, a lot of product went out the door to meet pent-up demand. So this is not inventory or pipeline. This is just pur sell-through filling in suction from the market for some really good products and those innovations are drawing that viral stuff that you heard me talk about in the prepared remarks. and the result it's not just a big beat but surprised us, especially in the back half of the quarter.\nFrank Camma -- Sidoti & Company, LLC -- Analyst\nWell, Beauty makes sense because you had success in the first -- in the last quarter. So I kind of see kind of a pull-through on that. But your numbers, your guidance for Housewares for the balance of the year would suggest no matter how you look at it, a huge deceleration in revenue growth. So, can you explain like how that works through your system?\nJulien R. Mininberg -- Chief Executive Officer\nYou mean versus the big number that was just presented?\nFrank Camma -- Sidoti & Company, LLC -- Analyst\nYeah, I mean your 23%.\nJulien R. Mininberg -- Chief Executive Officer\nThat's an increase for the year.\nFrank Camma -- Sidoti & Company, LLC -- Analyst\nWell, yeah, no, I get that, it's an increase in the year. But to get to a -- I thought you said a top-end of growth for the year -- of revenue growth was 8%, is that correct?\nBrian L. Grass -- Chief Financial Officer\nCorrect.\nJulien R. Mininberg -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. Early in the year --\nFrank Camma -- Sidoti & Company, LLC -- Analyst\nMathematically you have to grow like in the range of 4% to 5% for the balance of the year?\nBrian L. Grass -- Chief Financial Officer\nWell, keep in mind that the first quarter is a smaller quarter comparatively in absolute dollars, so the following quarters have much more ability to influenced the results. So I mean it's, -- you got to do the math in dollars. You can't just look at percentage is to be able to get there.\nJulien R. Mininberg -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes. And now on the size of the base in the different quarters, but the year-over-year of the prior year. So if you look at Q2 of Housewares -- so when you're asking about in the second quarter of last year, the growth from the year before was substantial, so to grow over that is a big number, we will, and then to grow further for the rest of the year than we originally pointed out, some of it's rolling through the beat that we just add to your question.\nAnd some of it -- it's just early days. We haven't seen the whole year play out yet. I'm not saying we'll do better, I'm simply saying might even turn out -- up from there. We'll see how the year plays out Frank.\nBrian L. Grass -- Chief Financial Officer\nHistorically the first quarter, is their small -- is their smaller sales quarter.\nFrank Camma -- Sidoti & Company, LLC -- Analyst\nNo, I get that, and you comp -- but you did comp against you're pretty much our biggest quarter from a year-over-year. So -- unless my numbers are wrong. So I think you had 19% year-over-year last year then you went to about 19% and then by fourth quarter, it decelerated to 8%, correct for Housewares?\nJulien R. Mininberg -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes. But careful with what Brian is saying it's one thing to do the percentages and getting it right. It's another thing to look at the dollars.\nBrian L. Grass -- Chief Financial Officer\nOkay.\nFrank Camma -- Sidoti & Company, LLC -- Analyst\nYeah. No. I get that. I don't want to be at that point, but OK. Can you just -- then I'll get out of line on this, but can you explain why the Beauty margin given the sales, now I'm just looking at it net of restructuring expenses, why the margin wouldn't have expanded more even when the (inaudible) were great.\nBrian L. Grass -- Chief Financial Officer\nRight. There is a fairly -- we called it out, there's a fairly significant amount of freight expense that we made the decision to incur in order to fulfill against the strong demand that we have for some of the products.\nAnd so we had to use expedited freight in order to meet that strong demand and we chose a lot of the options to make that choice, even though it does have a temporary drag on margins. We're out of the position where we'll need to incur that expense on a go-forward basis. So, we should no longer have that issue.\nFrank Camma -- Sidoti & Company, LLC -- Analyst\n(inaudible)\nBrian L. Grass -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. Correct.\nJulien R. Mininberg -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes. And remember, we're consumer-centric and there is a lot of draw for those products in the market. So it's one thing to say no to a customer, we don't have the product at the full level of order and allocate. It's another thing to make the choice to supply the market, satisfy the consumer with a product that we know is a winner and several of those innovations have just a lot of demand and we made that choice. As Brian mentioned, with the supply now significantly increased, we don't see that going forward. So there is a normalization.\nBrian L. Grass -- Chief Financial Officer\nWe also had a -- Frank the mix factor of the decline in Personal Care which has got a much right stronger margin that decreasing will have an impact on the overall margin.\nFrank Camma -- Sidoti & Company, LLC -- Analyst\nOkay, great. Thanks, guys.\nJulien R. Mininberg -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, you bet.\nBrian L. Grass -- Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Frank.\nOperator\nAnd we'll go next to Olivia Tong with Bank of America.\nOlivia Tong -- Bank of America -- Senior Analyst\nYeah, Thanks.\nBrian L. Grass -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes, hi, Olivia.\nOlivia Tong -- Bank of America -- Senior Analyst\nHow are you?\nBrian L. Grass -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. All right. Your first call with us, welcome. We're thrilled. I know you've been following the company for a long time, but great to see you on this call. Terrific, Olivia.\nOlivia Tong -- Bank of America -- Senior Analyst\nThank you. I appreciate it. First question is just around the incremental investment dollars. It sounds like you obviously had a nice quarter. So it sounds like you're -- or on growth investments, can you talk about where that incremental dollars going forward?\nBrian L. Grass -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. Great question. And we are increasing. We're very pleased to do that. The fuel from the first quarter result gives us the confidence, there's a lot of opportunities across the Leadership Brands. So it's concentrated in those seven brands. It's primarily going online. There is some money going into international expansion and there is a fair amount, focused on the digital marketing side of online as opposed to just the e-commerce support. So you'll see us very active on the Amazons of the world, on the e-commerce or e-tail side because that's where the consumer is and we are consumer-centric and the rest of that digital money is going against marketing campaigns for new items, feeding some of the viral stuffs that is just been so strong that we almost couldn't pour enough money into it at this point. And then as the seasons come up, whether it's cold-flu or the hot summer for example so that those are places where we didn't have to put marketing money against things like fans. So they sold themselves. Things like the cold-flu season or the upcoming heaters we'll see how the wildfires and all that stuff if there are any turnout.\nSo these are the places where the money will be spent and on the social media side, we found some really good levers with attractive ROIs and now that we have some more money to pour into them we will increase the investments.\nOlivia Tong -- Bank of America -- Senior Analyst\nSuper helpful. And then I want to talk a little bit about (inaudible) of the Housewares, it sounds like there are some things -- one-time or temporary in the great demand, so if you could perhaps break down a little bit the POS growth that you just presented, and is this distribution you Just One or so we shouldn't say three more quarters of elevated growth or is this also layering in prior gains? Are prior gains part of this?\nJulien R. Mininberg -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, understood. So we talk about both brand, OXO and Hydro Flask because that's Housewares, there is both positive but also different stories. So starting with OXO, OXO is fairly well penetrated in this country, in the United States, it does have lots of opportunities overseas and we are making progress overseas and we like what we see, on the one hand. On the other hand in the United States, some of the new products just earned incremental distribution at some of the biggest customers. And we are doing well on shelf, they are making decisions about rationalizing what they want on shelf and OXO is strong enough in its POS performance that it's emerging the victor in plenty of those decisions at buyer. So there is some incremental distribution there. We're leaning in online, online is doing very well for OXO in that incremental spending that I just referred to is helping to feed it and we're learning every day and just getting sharper and sharper on how we spend.\nAnd then new products themselves, they're just appealing to consumers and they are generally selling through very well. You heard us talk about our food storage and personal household organization stuff as two examples in the prepared remarks, this quarter, and POP 2.0 containers are specific. I think you saw those in the Innovation Showcase in the Investor Day, and they're pretty cool. The new coffee grinders are tearing up the track. They are winning all kinds of awards as well. So these are things that we're leaning into. In the case of Hydro Flask, Hydro Flask has earned a lot of new distribution, especially in the East Coast at a couple of big retailers who have leaned it on the category and specifically who leaned in on the brand and then we've earned more shelf space.\nWe're putting some very good items on the shelf and also some new ones. So that major outdoor sports and those retailers, they are now anniversarying, and so as a result, you're talking about pure sell-through and acceleration of the consumer appeal. And you can see it in the market share, actually, and I mentioned that we are expanding an already leadership position in the metal beverage-ware market share and that's a result of some of what I'm saying here. And then in terms of growth drivers the same that we've highlighted a couple of times on Hydro Flask beyond still winning distribution are hard at work. So I'm talking about the new products like the soft lines that we talked about, specifically in the call today, we even named a couple of specific items around the new hydration packs and there's a few other new packs that are just out there now and attractive to consumers. So the sell-through looks good.\nOther new products in the bottle space whether it's new colors, new shapes, new sizes, we have some very cool ones that are being introduced into the marketplace, customization and then lastly International, which is a growth driver for Hydro Flask, and a lot of white space for us on the subject of international. So this is where the sustainability comes from. I had the concern, frankly, from investors for probably about three years now, which is how could you keep that been growing. And with no arrogance of any kind its revenues are multiples of, when we bought it and it continues to grow very strongly.\nOlivia Tong -- Bank of America -- Senior Analyst\nAll right, thank you very much.\nOperator\nWe'll go next to Linda Bolton Weiser with D.A. Davidson.\nLinda Bolton Weiser -- DA Davidson -- Analyst\nHi. So just keeping on the topic of the growth of Housewares, in terms of what inning Hydro Flask is in, In terms of distribution gains, what inning would you say it's in?\nBrian L. Grass -- Chief Financial Officer\nI would say in the US, it's probably in the later part of the middle innings. So think like sixth inning, something like that,\nJulien R. Mininberg -- Chief Executive Officer\nBut just with respect to bottles its core category -- it has new categories that where distributions can still be gained.\nBrian L. Grass -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, I'm talking about bottles, so if you back up like two, three years primarily West Coast heavy brand, which is just crushing it on the West Coast expanded into the Midwest. It started expanding into the Southwest and then into the East. The Southeast is still even still a little under developed the Northeast just a year ago was under developed, so this is the trip from -- call it the second inning to the third, fourth, fifth like that. It's probably more like the sixth now and I think there is incremental distribution yet to be earned for Hydro Flask, it is setting trends and myself was just in Northern California for some business things a week or so ago I was on a campus of a major university there, there were tons of kids and doing all kinds of sports things. I'll tell you the teams of 20-30 kids were walking by and there were easily 15 and 18 Hydro Flasks in a pod (ph) of 20 kids and a lot of them were the newer colors.\nSo even in a place where the distribution is in its higher innings like California where a lot of this started, you're seeing the new items penetrate far and all kinds of users coming in and buying into the trend and want these products. So it's not just about innings of distribution, it's about new items that are driving existing distribution into new sell-through. And then when you talk about international even though we're doing very well, the whole doubling down thing I'd tell you it'd be in order to say all the opportunities and to see all the places where we are, there are just so many ways to grow, but I'd say they were probably in the second inning at most on the subject of -- maybe first on the subject of a distribution opportunities in the developed part of the world. And then the specific countries where we've chosen, obviously for competitive reasons we wouldn't list them all, but the intention is to drive far in the international where eight of the nine innings are left to develop.\nLinda Bolton Weiser -- DA Davidson -- Analyst\nOkay. And then, can I just ask, on the Health and Home, I think your prior year comparison gets even tougher in the second quarter, so I mean if I could say -- could core sales be down actually like 10% or more in the second quarter. And then, if so, it really has to be a big ramp in the second half. Is there any particular new product launch or any kind of comparison issue that would give us confidence you can really see a much higher growth rate in the second half of the fiscal?\nBrian L. Grass -- Chief Financial Officer\nFor Health and Home in particular?\nJulien R. Mininberg -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes, so she is asking.\nBrian L. Grass -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, you mentioned 10% I would say we're not expecting a 10% decline in the second quarter, but I think it's safe to assume we're expecting a decline, but somewhere in the range of 0% to 5% for Health and Home.\nJulien R. Mininberg -- Chief Executive Officer\nBut to be clear, that's not because of some sort of huge weakness, it's because of -- your point that you just made, that base is a monster in the year ago period. We're very proud of that result, now we're over it that's a hard thing to do. And so that's what's doing the math of that decline he is talking about.\nBrian L. Grass -- Chief Financial Officer\nDoes that answer all the questions.\nLinda Bolton Weiser -- DA Davidson -- Analyst\nYeah, it did, excellent. And then on the tariffs, can you just remind us on the List-3, which I guess it's 25% correct. When is that effective?\nJulien R. Mininberg -- Chief Executive Officer\nIt's already effective and our pricing is already effective.\nBrian L. Grass -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah and the moves on the very high base --\nJulien R. Mininberg -- Chief Executive Officer\nSorry or it may be you're talking about List-4, not three? There is a List-4 that's on a very large group of items, including iPhones and things like that, that has not been put into place. It's been -- it was announced, and then it was delayed pending a potential trade deal negotiation. There was a List-3 that was announced and implemented to go from 10% to 25%. It has been put in place and we have implemented our pricing actions on it.\nLinda Bolton Weiser -- DA Davidson -- Analyst\nOkay and then just on the $0.20 difference between your beat and your guidance raise for those three things. Is there any way to break down the $0.20 by FX the UK taxing and the investment increase?\nJulien R. Mininberg -- Chief Executive Officer\nThey actually work out to be kind of the equal -- roughly equal among all three. So if you want to work with that you can.\nLinda Bolton Weiser -- DA Davidson -- Analyst\nOkay, thank you very much. I appreciate it.\nJulien R. Mininberg -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. Thanks. And then the one thing I want to say, before we move to the next question, and a lot of you have asked about Housewares sustainability because of the big beat in the total guidance for the year. I wanted to emphasize a point that I know we hit in the prepared remarks, but not in the response to your question, which is this concept of Just One More, is a very powerful one on Hydro Flask and so is the idea of Beyond-the-Bottle. And so we are amping up our ability in the categories we're already strong like the beverage bottles to bring it -- it's probably not just one more but just several more into many people's households and for those of you who have teenagers or something like that in your house or their friends. I don't know how many times you've heard, something along the lines of, yes but the new one, meaning the new size or the new color or I've seen my friend has this cool thing and I'm interested in it, too, I can tell you it's very true on the college campuses and there's people now that are going to insulated bottles Hydro Flask is winning and then you're even seeing some of those kids with multiple Hydro Flasks. You think of a gym one versus the one you take the classes, different sizes and caps and things like that.\nAnd on the subject of Beyond-the-Bottle, the soft lines -- we talked about them in the call, but I really want to emphasize that any new distribution there is just incremental distribution and because we started off small there. It's not our heritage, our heritage was in the bottles. That's all incremental growth for us. And then we are innovating and those hydration packs that we just called out today for like mountain biking, and hiking and also the women's version. These are innovative and we'll see how it all sells through, but we like our prospects on the subject of Beyond-the-Bottle.\nLinda Bolton Weiser -- DA Davidson -- Analyst\nThank you.\nJulien R. Mininberg -- Chief Executive Officer\nYou bet.\nOperator\nAt this time, I'd like to pass it back to management for any additional or closing comments.\nBrian L. Grass -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes.

They are believed to have been 12 or 13 when they were beaten to death for helping Dominican missionaries.\nThe pope also canonized 30 martyrs who were killed for their faith in Brazil in 1645. They included two Portuguese missionaries and 28 followers killed by Dutch colonial soldiers during a period of persecution of Catholics.\nIn announcing the 2019 synod for bishops from the Amazon region, Francis said indigenous people there today were \u201coften abandoned and without the prospect of a bright future, even due to the crisis of the Amazon Forest, a lung of utmost importance for our planet\u201d.\nFrancis, an Argentine and the first Latin American pope, has often linked his calls for social justice, particularly for indigenous people, to those for defense of the environment, saying the poor will suffer the most from the effects of climate change.\nIn 2015 he wrote a landmark encyclical, or papal letter, on defense of the environment and he has called for special protection for the Amazon region because of its vital importance to the planet\u2019s ecosystem.\nSlideshow (5 Images)\nIn his comments on Sunday, the pope did not mention the role of the Church in suppressing native cultures in the New World.\nBut during a visit to Bolivia in 2015, Francis said \u201cmany grave sins were committed against the native people of America in the name of God\u201d. He asked forgiveness for the Church, for \u201ccrimes committed against native peoples during the so-called conquest of America\u201d.\nOn Sunday, Francis also canonized Father Faustino Miguez, a Spanish priest who lived in the 19th and 20th centuries, and Father Angelo d\u2019Acri, an Italian itinerant preacher who died in 1739 after serving in some of the most remote areas of mountainous southern Italy."}

These were mounted on spears and used as projectile weapons.\nWhere 98% of the rock previously used by people in the Olorgesailie area had come from within a 5km radius, there were no sources of obsidian nearby.\nPeople were travelling from 25km to 95km across rugged terrain to obtain the material, and \"interacting with other groups of early humans over that time period\", according to Dr Potts.\nThis makes the site the earliest known example of such long distance transport, and possibly of trade.\nThere is additional evidence that the inhabitants, who would likely have lived in small groups of 20-25 people, also used pigments like ochre. It is unclear whether these were merely practical or had a ritual social application.\nDr Marta Mirazon Lahr from the University of Cambridge said that being able to \"securely date\" the continuous occupation of the site using argon techniques on volcanic deposits \"makes Olorgesailie a key reference site for understanding human evolution in Africa during [this period]\".\nHuman origins\nDr Scerri, who was not involved in the studies, emphasised that they are valuable in implying that \"Middle Stone Age technology emerged at the same time in both eastern and northwestern Africa.\"\nProf Chris Stringer from the Natural History Museum agrees.\n\"This makes me think that the Middle Stone Age probably already existed in various parts of Africa by 315,000 years ago, rather than originating in one place at that time and then spreading,\" he said.\nWhile the behaviours exhibited at the Kenya site are characteristic of Homo sapiens, there are as yet no fossils associated with this time period and location.\nThe oldest known Homo sapiens fossils were discovered in Morocco, and are dated to between 300,000 and 350,000 years old.\nFor more on this story, listen to Science in Action on the World Service on Thursday 20:30 GMT, or catch up on iPlayer."}

With little changes here and there, 2019 was the year of influencer beauty brands. However, 2020 has something new in the bag, given the eco-friendly and climate change initiatives.\nAlso, a new Gen-Z social media platform is shaping up, so here are six trends WTVOX foresees as the primary drivers giving a new direction to the overall beauty landscape this year:\n1. Luxury Skincare For Babies\nAccording to Euromonitor, luxury skincare for babies is a niche market with huge potential. A $3.6 billion global baby and child skincare market that grew by 9 per cent last year, with premium and luxury products making up 45 per cent of the market.\nThe data is backed up by Mintel, stating that three in four parents spend more money on personal care products for their children than for themselves.\n2. The Next Social Media Giant\nWhen it comes to online marketing, Facebook and Instagram remain the key platforms to go-to. However, beauty brands have started to embrace TikTok this year. Mac Cosmetics, an early adopter of TikTok, has experimented with the app since 2019, as a critical way to reach younger customers.\nIt is a trend that\u2019s taking over the beauty sector as the \u2018youngster\u2019 social media platform has the fastest adoption ever seen.\n3. Products Without Water\nGrowing concerns relating to pollution and environmental sustainability have impacted brands from all over the world. Water, in particular, has become an expensive luxury, leading to a rise in waterless beauty brands and products.\n2020 will see lots of brands launching waterless serums, creams, and all sorts of products aiming to reduce water consumption and waste. Only if we can use it to put away the bushfires in Australia\u2026\n4. Mindful Packaging\nGrowing consumer knowledge about single-use plastics has impacted the beauty industry as well, forcing companies to change not just product but also their packaging offerings.\nLa Bouche Rouge and Kjaer Weis, for example, have become popular, in part, thanks to the use of refillable metal packaging, designed to cut down on environmental waste.\n5. Influencer Own Brand\nKeeping up with the beauty trends of 2019, social media influencers are launching their own beauty labels, as a requisite to one\u2019s celebrity status.\nFollowing on the steps of Jaclyn Hill, Nikita Dragun, Tati Westbrook, and Patrick Ta who have launched their own beauty labels last year, in 2020 we see Kylie Jenner and Huda Kattan starting in force with their own beauty lines.\n6. Corporations Embrace Natural\nThe industry\u2019s most significant companies are embracing \u2018natural beauty\u2019 in several ways. Fast track to one of the fastest-growing beauty trends this year is achieved by clean beauty brands.\nSee Shiseido purchase of Drunk Elephant for $845 million, or Unilever\u2019s acquisition of Tatcha for $500 million.

Unofficially called a \"sanctuary state\" bill, supporters, such as California Gov. Jerry Brown, said it \"prohibits the commandeering of local officials to do the work of immigration agents.\"\nThe White House has not responded to a CNN request for comment. But the marijuana announcement wasn't the only move the Trump administration made Thursday which could run afoul of California -- but not national -- law.\nUS Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said the US would undo an Obama-era action and explore new offshore oil drilling, including off the coast of California, where there have been no new leases granted in decades.\n\"It's better to produce energy here and never be held hostage by foreign enemy needs,\" Zinke said, adding it's a \"clear difference between energy weakness and energy dominance.\"\nRELATED: Trump administration plans to roll back ban on offshore drilling\nBut it's also a slap, intended or not, at Brown, who has been hitting the federal government for being absent at international climate summits and raising alarm bells about climate change.\nThat's the backdrop for new oil drilling off the coast of the state. The new oil leases wouldn't be offered until 2019, but California is already plotting a fight, according to the state's attorney general, Xavier Becerra.\n\"It should be underscored that regulatory agencies in our state will have a say in whether any offshore drilling ultimately does occur. Irrespective of the Trump administration's backwards action today, California will continue to lead the way on reducing our dependence on fossil fuels.\"\nThat last point is key. California's isn't just the richest and biggest US state. It's also one of the most regulated, with its own environmental protection agency. Brown has said the ultimate effect of Trump withdrawing the US from the otherwise worldwide Paris climate accord would be small if states stepped up instead of the federal government.\nCNN's Christiane Amanpour recently asked Brown what California will do on its own and he had a ready list of actions the state has undertaken on its own.\n\"Well, we have the 30% of our energy renewable. It will be 50% in a few more years. We have a strong -- a policy for electric and hydrogen vehicles. We have a cap and trade system, a low carbon fuel standard. We have very strict energy efficiency for buildings for appliances. We have our land use rules, now, being aligned with a lower carbon footprint.\"\nSome critics even say California, where the state government is actively engaged on the climate debate in place of the US government, is not doing nearly enough on the issue. Brown was booed by protesters while giving his speech at the COP23 conference in Bonn, Germany, in November.\nBut he was there, unlike Trump or Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt.\nIt's not just California that opposes Trump's policies on oil drilling, climate change and immigration.\nBrown reacted to the oil drilling news with a joint statement from governors representing the entire West Coast, which has also legalized recreational marijuana. The entire West Coast also voted overwhelmingly against Trump. He's the first President in decades not to visit the largest by population US state during his first year as President.\nOn the other hand, Trump this week also declared a major disaster in California after devastating wildfires that began last year.\nAnd it isn't novel for a state to become the focus of resistance to the party controlling the federal government. Texas and its former governor, Rick Perry, played a similar role under former President Barack Obama.\nBut it is certainly interesting that on so many issues, the administration finds itself lining up against the same foe."}

In May of 2014, I wrote:\nWhile it is likely oil prices could get a bit of a bump from a decline in the U.S. dollar, ultimately it will come down to the fundamentals longer term. It is quite clear that the speculative rise in oil prices due to the 'fracking miracle' has come to its inglorious, but expected conclusion\u2026It is quite apparent that some lessons are simply never learned.\"\nOf course, as with all things, particularly when it comes to commodities, it doesn't take long for speculation to once again grab hold and drive prices higher in the short-term despite the long-term fundamental problems which still exist.\nIn September of 2017, I wrote a piece reviewing those fundamentals.\nI have been getting a tremendous number of emails as of late asking if the latest rally in oil prices, and related energy stocks, is sustainable or is it another 'trap' as has been witnessed previously.\nAs regular readers know, we exited oil and gas stocks back in mid-2014 and have remained out of the sector for technical and fundamental reasons for the duration. While there have been some opportunistic trading setups, the technical backdrop has remained decidedly bearish.\"\nThe conclusion was not what most were hoping for.\nWhile there is hope the production cuts will continue into 2018, a bulk of the current price gain has likely already been priced in. With oil prices once again overbought on a monthly basis, the risk of disappointment is substantial.\"\nWell, here we are wrapping up 2018 and the prices of both energy-related shares and oil have been disappointing.\nThe expected decline in oil prices is more important than just the relative decline in share prices of energy-related stocks. As I wrote previously, energy prices are highly correlated to economic activity. To wit:\nOil is a highly sensitive indicator relative to the expansion or contraction of the economy. Given that oil is consumed in virtually every aspect of our lives, from the food we eat to the products and services we buy, the demand side of the equation is a tell-tale sign of economic strength or weakness.\nThe chart below combines interest rates, inflation, and GDP into one composite indicator to provide a clearer comparison to oil prices. One important note is that oil tends to trade along a pretty defined trend\u2026until it doesn't. Given that the oil industry is very manufacturing and production intensive, breaks of price trends tend to be liquidation events which have a negative impact on the manufacturing and CapEx spending inputs into the GDP calculation.\nAs such, it is not surprising that sharp declines in oil prices have been coincident with downturns in economic activity, a drop in inflation, and a subsequent decline in interest rates.\"\nSince then, the price of oil has declined further as economic weakness continues to gain traction globally. Despite the occasional rally, it's hard to see the outlook for oil is encouraging on both fundamental and technical levels. The charts for WTI remain bearish, while the fundamentals remain basically \"Economics 101: too much supply, too little demand.\" The parallel with 2014 is there if you want to see it.\nThe current levels of supply potentially create a longer-term issue for prices globally particularly in the face of weaker global demand due to demographics, energy efficiencies, and debt.\nMany point to the 2008 commodity crash as THE example as to why oil prices are destined to rise in the near term. The clear issue remains supply as it relates to the price of any commodity. With drilling in the Permian Basin expanding currently, any \"cuts\" by OPEC have already been offset by increased domestic production. As I stated previously, any rise in oil prices beyond $55/bbl would likely make the OPEC \"cuts\" very short-lived which indeed turned out to be the case.\nAs noted in the chart above, the difference between 2008 and today is that previously the world was fearful of \"running out\" of oil versus worries about an \"oil glut\" today. The issues of supply versus price become clearer if we look further back in history to the last crash in commodity prices which marked an extremely long period of oil price suppression as supply was reduced.\nThe problem with the recent surge in oil prices was that it was being driven by speculative excess. As I noted in \"Everyone Is On The Same Side Of The Boat:\"\nOf course, the cycle of rising oil prices leading to increased optimism which begets bullish bets on oil continues to press prices higher. However, it is also the exuberance which has repeatedly set up the next fall. As shown below, bets on crude oil prices are sitting near the highest levels on record and substantially higher than what was seen at the peak of oil prices prior to 2008 and 2014.\"\nWhen I wrote that in May of this year (2018), it received a lot of criticism about my misunderstanding of global demand and explanations of why oil prices could only go higher.\nIt didn't take long for reality to take hold.\nThe Headwinds For Oil Remain\nIn 2008, when prices crashed, the supply of into the marketplace had hit an all-time low while global demand was at an all-time high. Remember, the fears of \"peak oil\" was rampant in news headlines and in the financial markets. Of course, the financial crisis took hold and quickly realigned prices with demand.\nOf course, the supply-demand imbalance, combined with suppressed commodity prices in 2008, was the perfect cocktail for a surge in prices as the \"fracking miracle\" came into focus. The surge of supply alleviated the fears of oil company stability and investors rushed back into energy-related companies to \"feast\" on the buffet of accelerating profitability into the infinite future.\nThe problem currently, and as of yet not fully recognized, is the supply-demand imbalance has once again reverted. With supply now at the highest levels on record, and global demand growth weak due to a rolling debt-cycle driven global deflationary cycle, the dynamics for a repeat of the pre-2008 surge in prices is unlikely.\nThe supply-demand problem is not likely to be resolved over the course of a few months either. The current dynamics of the financial markets, global economies, and the current level of supply is more akin to that of the early-1980s. Even if OPEC does continue to reduce output, it will continue to be insufficient to offset the increases from shale field production.\nSince oil production, at any price, is the major part of the revenue streams of energy-related companies, it is unlikely they will dramatically gut their production in the short-term. The important backdrop is extraction from shale continues to become cheaper and more efficient all the time. In turn, this lowers the price point where production becomes profitable increases the supply coming to market.\nThen there is the demand side of the equation.\nFor example, my friend Jill Mislinski discussed the issue of a weak economic backdrop.\nThere are profound behavioral issues apart from gasoline prices that are influencing miles traveled. These would include the demographics of an aging population in which older people drive less, continuing high unemployment, the ever-growing ability to work remote in the era of the Internet and the use of ever-growing communication technologies as a partial substitute for face-to-face interaction.\"\nThe problem with dropping demand, of course, is the potential for the creation of a \"supply glut\" that leads to a continued suppression in oil prices.\nThe headwinds to higher oil prices from the demand side come in a variety of forms:\nWeak economic global growth over the last decade which will remain weak going forward\nSlow and steady growth of renewable/alternative sources of energy\nTechnological improvements in energy production, storage and transfer, and;\nA rapidly aging global demographic\nAdd to those issues that over the next few years EVERY major auto supplier will be continuously rolling out more efficient automobiles including larger offerings of hybrid and fully electric vehicles.\nAll this boils down to a long-term, secular, and structurally bearish story.\nWith respect to investors, the argument can be made that oil prices have likely found a long-term bottom in the $40 range. However, the fundamental tailwinds for substantially higher prices are still vacant. OPEC won't keep cutting production forever, the global economy remains weak, and efficiencies are suppressing demand.\nFurthermore, given the length of the current economic expansion, the onset of the next recession is likely closer than not. A recession will negatively impact oil prices (which are driven by commodity traders) and energy investments as the proverbial \"baby is thrown out with the bathwater.\"\nThis is where we will be looking for long-term bargains in the space."}
